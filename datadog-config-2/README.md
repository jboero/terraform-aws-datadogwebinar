# Creating Dashboard based on exported JSON, monitors,...

The content of this repository is a close copy of [hashicorp/observability-as-code](https://github.com/hashicorp/observability-as-code), adapted to the latest version of the Datadog provider at time of writing (3.18.0).

Some changes have been made on the monitors and dashboard to better fit the new environment.
