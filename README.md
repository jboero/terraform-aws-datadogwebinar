# HashiTalks

HashiTalks is a 24-hour virtual event produced by the HashiCorp Community Team and is hosted annually on the second-to-last Thursday in February. The first HashiTalks was in 2019, and the program continues to grow year-over-year. In 2020 we were able to connect with an audience of over 10,000. The CFP is open to the community for submissions on how they utilize HashiCorp tools, both for open-source (OSS) and enterprise (ENT) versions, in their workflows.

Confirmed Talks are 30 minutes long, recorded, and available on YouTube and HashiCorp's Resources Library soon after the virtual event and shared throughout the year. HashiTalks speakers are encouraged to submit to the CFP for our in-person conferences: HashiConf and HashiDays. We host speaker enablement sessions and invite all CFP submissions to join and learn from industry leader, Wesley Reisz, on best practices and common "gotchas" in presenting digitally. 

See the project tab for a breakout of all steps and more details in planning HashiTalks. 
Where able, the project plan is event-agnostic, but as this is modeled after HashiTalks, some details are HashiCorp specific and are encouraged to be applied elsewhere.

For HashiTalks, we utilized Zoom Webinar and crossposted to YouTube Live. We are evaluating new platforms for HashiTalks 2021. 

Throughout the year, we will be hosting many smaller Regional HashiTalks that will be 8 hours long.
